The Not-So-Smart Assistant is a quirky, humorous virtual assistant designed to answer simple questions and provide light-hearted responses. Unlike a typical AI assistant, it's intentionally created with a playful, "not-so-smart" personality, often delivering answers that are witty, sarcastic, or just a bit clueless. This assistant can recognize basic categories like time, weather, jokes, and motivation, offering randomized responses within each category to keep interactions fresh and entertaining. Its responses are filled with self-aware humor, making it an amusing companion rather than a serious information sourceâ€”perfect for quick laughs or a casual chat!
